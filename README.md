## 🚀 Goals

- **Instant Task Tracking:** Provide a zero‑friction interface for jotting down and completing tasks in seconds.  
- **Offline‑First:** Work seamlessly without a back‑end; all data persists in the browser (LocalStorage).  
- **Mobile‑Friendly:** Ensure a responsive UI that adapts beautifully to both desktop and mobile screens.

## 🛠️ Process

1. **Design & Prototyping**  
   - Sketched wireframes to identify core flows: add, complete, and remove tasks.  
   - Defined a simple data schema for in‑browser storage.

2. **Implementation**  
   - Built the UI in **HTML5/CSS3** (Flexbox/Grid) for rapid layout.  
   - Developed interactivity in **plain JavaScript**, using event delegation and the browser’s LocalStorage API.  
   - Added subtle animations (task fade‑in/out) for a polished feel.

3. **Testing & Refinement**  
   - Manually tested on major browsers and viewports.  
   - Tweaked styles & scripts for performance (minimized repaint/reflow).  
   - Ensured accessibility by using semantic HTML and ARIA attributes.
